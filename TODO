 - [ ] searchDatabase (and possibly other slots) differ in pepXML files 
       generated by Mascot2XML and pepZML exported by Mascot. The 
       parseMSMSpepXML has been designed to work with the latter and 
       crashes with the former:
       Error in checkSlotAssignment(object, name, value) : 
       assignment of an object of class "NULL" is not valid for slot 
       "searchDatabase" in an object of class "MSMSpepXML"; 
       is(value, "character") is not TRUE
 - [ ] pepSequence, scores,... for higher level classes (MSMSpepXML, 
       SpectrumQuery,...)
 - [ ] Handle comments in pepXML file
